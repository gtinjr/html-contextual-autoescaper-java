A runtime contextual autoescaper written in Java.

This provides a writer-like object that provides two methods:

  writeSafe(String)
  write(Object)

so that the sequence of calls

 w.writeSafe("<b>");
 w.write("I <3 Ponies!");
 w.writeSafe("</b>\n<button onclick=foo(");
 w.writeObject(ImmutableMap.<String, Object>of(
     "foo", "bar", "\"baz\"", 42));
 w.writeSafe(")>");

results in the output

  <b>I &lt;3 Ponies!</b>
  <button onclick="foo({&#34;foo&#34;:&#34;\x22bar\x22&#34;:42})">

The safe parts are treated as literal chunks of HTML/CSS/JS, and the unsafe
parts are escaped to preserve security and least-surprise.
